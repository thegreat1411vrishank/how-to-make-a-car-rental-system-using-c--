## Project Description
This is a simple, easy-to-understand C++ Car Rental Management System very useful for learning about keyboard events, date-time functions, and implementing a C++ login system. 
It is based on the concept of maintaining rental records and generating the total charge on the rented car.

### Main Features
<ul>
  <li>Separate menus for admin and other users</li>
  <li>Login existing users</li>
  <li>Register new users and sign them in</li>
  <li>Adding new cars to and deleting cars from the system</li>
  <li>Displaying car details and their availability</li>
  <li>Calculate charges on the car rented</li>  
</ul>

## Installation and Usage
### Download
> Executable  is available for [Windows](https://github.com/thegreat1411vrishank/how-to-make-a-car-rental-system-using-c--/blob/master/main.exe)

### Compiling
> To compile and run the project, any C++-compliant compiler should work. For compilers with partial C++11 support, it may work.
If nullptr is not supported by your compiler then this can be emulated using the header lib/cxx11emu.h

#### Steps to compile:
1. Fork and clone this repository. To learn how to fork a repository, see the GitHub documentation on how to [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). 
    * Copies of repositories on your machine are called clones. If you need help cloning to your local environment you can learn how from the GitHub documentation on [cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
    Use `git` to clone your fork.
    
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/how-to-make-a-car-rental-system-using-c--.git
  ```
